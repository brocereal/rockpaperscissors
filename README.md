___
so this is going to be a game of some kind. <br>
a rock paper scissors kind of game you could say.

how i imagine it is a 2-player 2D game. you got rock, paper and scissors that you can interchange throughout the game
and the goal is to just touch the other player and if youre on top in the triangle then you win. <br>
Each character will have its own upside and downside like rock being the faster or some other traits but I haven't
completely figured out the balance yet.<br>
